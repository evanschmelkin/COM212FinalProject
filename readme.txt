This is a Java program, so it must be ran with Java.
It is a console based social networking profile
Everything will be in terminal or command prompt.

Run the MySocialProfileApp.java file
For the fullest user experience of our
Console based interface.

As long as everything is kept in the same
place in the file directory as was intended,
it should run just fine.

Everything with the user interface should
be about what you expect, this project
follows the directions for the MySocialProfile
very closely.

Hope you have a great summer,
I am glad to have learned as much in this class
as I did.
